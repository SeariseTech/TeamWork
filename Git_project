bool: canonicalize values as either "true" or "false".

int: canonicalize values as simple decimal numbers. An optional suffix of k, m, or g will cause the value to be multiplied by 1024, 1048576, or 1073741824 upon input.

bool-or-int: canonicalize according to either bool or int, as described above.

path: canonicalize by adding a leading ~ to the value of $HOME and ~user to the home directory for the specified user. This specifier has no effect when setting the value (but you can use git config section.variable ~/ from the command line to let your shell do the expansion.)

expiry-date: canonicalize by converting from a fixed or relative date-string to a timestamp. This specifier has no effect when setting the value.

color: When getting a value, canonicalize by converting to an ANSI color escape sequence. When setting a value, a sanity-check is performed to ensure that the given value is canonicalize-able as an ANSI color, but it is written as-is.
